Joint Dependency Parsing and Named Entity Recognition using Neural Networks
===========

Our parser is based on the transition-based parser by Chen. et al (A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks). This package is also based on Stanford CoreNLP (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP).
